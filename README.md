JaMoveo is a full-stack web application designed to enhance musical rehearsals by allowing musicians to connect via their phones, register with their instrument, and join live rehearsal sessions.

## Features

- **Signup & Login**: Users can sign up with their username, password, and instrument. Admins can register from a separate page.
